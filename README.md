# Up For Grabs!

## What is this?
Currently under construction, this is a backend API that's built on Node, using Express and MongoDB, and uses an AnguarJS frontend. Although the project is a work in progress and not currently hosted, feel free to check out the code. Essentially Hinge for apartment hunting, it takes the anonymity out of finding a roommate.

### Where this is going:
By using Facebook Authentication, the app will use 2nd degree connections through the social media site to allow users to either A.) Search for open room/apartment by city or B.) Post an opening (think Craigslist classifieds but without the sometimes sketchy interactions and vetting process one typically has to go through).


### Unsolved Problems & Possible Bugs
One of the biggest lessons I have learned through starting this project is not to force an application into specific frameworks or setups. What I mean is that all software has different advantages and disadvantages in any given circumstance. For this particular app, I had decided from the get-go that I was going to use a NoSQL database along with Angular frontend. However, the structure and relationships of my data makes much more sense within a relational database. Had I built this using a rails backend for example, my routes and ability to retrieve data would have been much more concise.
